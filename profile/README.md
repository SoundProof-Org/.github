# SoundProof IP

Soundproof aims to solve one key problem: formally documenting ownership in a decentralised market in a transparent yet enforceable way, based on NFTs(Non-Foungible-Token) on blockchain. The key enabler underpinning this vision is a protocol, sitting both on-chain and off-chain.
This protocol is called the “Legitimacy of Sale Protocol” or LOSP.
 A LOSP is a new way of looking at how to protect creators’ intellectual property rights (IPR) and those wanting to purchase or license them. It’s a legally binding agreement that validates participants and wraps a legal framework around the ownership of assets and therefore safely underpins future online transactions.
